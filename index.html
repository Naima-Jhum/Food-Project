                    <p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies
                        that are so good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious
                        meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix
                        of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than
                        in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect solution: they’re simple to toss together, but
                        they’re totally delicious nonetheless.
